## Current Web3 Focus

I am actively diving into decentralized systems and currently building a **Prediction Market DApp** inspired by the architecture of Polymarket. This is a deep dive into core blockchain principles.

* **Project Focus:** Developing **Solidity smart contracts** on the **Polygon network** to implement the **Conditional Token Framework (CTF)** for market creation and automated settlement.
* **Key Learning:** Integrating **decentralized oracles (e.g., UMA)** and managing a **hybrid Order Book** approach to ensure transparent and efficient trading mechanics.
