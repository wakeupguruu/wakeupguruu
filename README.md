# 👋 Hello, I'm Guru

### Full-Stack Developer (Learning AI + Web3)

I'm an early-stage developer who enjoys building projects to understand real technology — from full-stack apps to small AI experiments and beginner Web3 concepts.  
I’m still learning and improving, but I like taking on projects that challenge me and teach me something new.

## What I'm Learning Right Now

### **Web3 Basics**
I’m exploring decentralized systems by building a simple **Prediction Market DApp** as a learning exercise.

## 🚀 Projects I Built to Learn

### **1. EdVid — AI-Driven Video Generator (Learning Project)**
A small experiment combining:

- Next.js + TypeScript  
- LLM prompt handling  
- The **Manim** animation engine  

I built this mainly to understand how AI tools and animation workflows connect.

### **2. Peer-to-Peer Wallet System (Practice Full-Stack Project)**
A learning project where I implemented:

- Simple wallet transfers  
- Webhook-like logic  
- Docker + GitHub Actions for basic CI/CD  

This helped me understand backend architecture and deployment patterns.

### **3. Dark PDF — Client-Side Utility**
A small frontend tool that converts light PDFs to dark mode **entirely on the client side**, with no backend needed.
